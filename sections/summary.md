### What we've learned

Let's take a moment to review what we've learned.

At the end of the lesson, how can you directly and explicitly connect the lessons they've learned in this lesson with what is coming next? For example, how does it help with learning git? How does it help with HTML/CSS or GIS or other courses along the way.

What are the most salient take aways from the lesson?

This is a good time to also do a quick review:

In this session, we learned:
- common commands to create files (`touch` and `echo`) 
- learn commands to create directories (`mkdir`)
- navigate our file structure using change directory (`cd`), print working directory (`pwd`), and list (`ls`)
- move content from one place to another using redirects (`<`) and pipes (`|`)
- explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts, `head` and `tail`, and the concatenate command `cat`
- search text files using the `grep` command
- create and sort cheat sheets for the commands we learn

When we started, we reviewed what the difference was between a .txt and a .rtf file was. We learned that text editors that we want to use are a kind of software that doesn't allow for formatting of font, like color and size. Text editors are a different piece of software than Bash, which is a text-based shell that allows you to interact directly with your operating system giving direct input and receiving output. We learned commands that help you navigate your computer's file system.... (etc. etc.)

### Before we finish...

Before you leave today, we're going to prepare a little for our upcoming sessions. In your projects folder on the desktop, we're going to create a folder to house our cheat sheets for the week, as well as a new folder for the upcoming databases workshop.

```
$ pwd
/Users/jojo/Desktop/projects
$ mkdir cheatsheets
$ mkdir databases
```

Then move your `cheat-sheet.txt` file into your `cheatsheets` folder and your `nypl_items.csv` into your `databases` folder with the `mv` command:

```
$ mv cheat-sheet.txt cheatsheets
$ mv nypl_items.csv databases
```

### Moving forward

Connect skill to what's coming up

### What next?

That's the end of the command line session, but if you want to continue to learn about the command line, take a look at the [other useful commands](other-commands.md) or [additional challenges](challenges.md).

Here is another command line tutorial that will help you review and learn more.

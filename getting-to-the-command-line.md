When you see the `$`, you're in the right place.

### Windows

We won't be using Windows's own, non-UNIX version of the command line. Follow these steps to install Git Bash, which we will use in this session:

1\. Download [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) and install it.
2\. Click the Windows button on the bottom left of your desktop (or hit the Windows button on your keyboard).  
3\. In Programs, open the Git folder.  
4\. Select "Git Bash." (Not "Git GUI.")

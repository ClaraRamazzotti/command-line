## Commands

### Navigation

`pwd` - show the current (or "working") directory. Stands for "print working directory"

`ls` - show the files and folders in the working directory. I think of it as standing for "list stuff," but it's probably just short for "list."

`cd` - move to a directory, i.e. `cd Desktop` will move to the "Desktop" folder. Some special cases:

- `cd ..` - go to the directory above
- `cd ~` go to your "home" directory, i.e. /Users/<yourname>
- `cd` (by itself) also goes to the home directory
- `cd -` go to the last directory you were in before the current
- `cd ../..` travel two directories up
- `cd Documents/thesis-drafts` move two directories, from the home folder to "thesis-drafts," skipping "Documents"

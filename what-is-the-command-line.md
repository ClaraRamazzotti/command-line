### What is the command line?

The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer. You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them [in the glossary](glossary.md).)

### Why is the command line useful?

Initially, the command line can seem like a weird and old-fashioned way of interacting with the computer. However, by using the command line, you're stepping away from an environment where things are done for you and moving into an environment where you have more control. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you're stepping into the kitchen. It's more work, but there are also more possibilities. 

The command line lets you easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files. It's also a strong compliment to programming, as you'll often set up your programming environment and run programs using the command line. There are many programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivelants, and so learning the command line opens up a variety of new approaches you can use in your projects and research. Finally, advanced users can use the command line to connect and send commands to remote machines, a technique that is very useful when building websites and applications.
